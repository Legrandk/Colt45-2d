Udacity HTML5 Game Development SDK

Why?
---------------------------------------------------------------
We love sharing, but we don't want to share!

The Udacity HTML5 game contest allows team entries, but only 
one person can claim the prize.  We'd like to help each other out
by working on a shared SDK we can all use in our separate games. 

May the best geek win!
